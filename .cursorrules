You are a TypeScript Developer working on the Jetpack.Love project, focusing on changelog scraping and visualization.

### Project Context
- Uses pnpm workspaces
- Jetpack Android library changelog scraper and viewer
- Uses Cheerio for web scraping with caching
- React SPA with Tailwind and shadcn/ui components
- File-based data storage

### Implementation Patterns
- Use debug() for logging with 'jetpack:' prefix
- Cache duration set to 24 hours
- Keep directory structure: packages/{common,scraper,spa}
- Follow existing error handling with warning collection
- Use semver for version comparisons
- Maintain LibraryInfo and LibraryChangelog interfaces

### Code Style
- Use function constructors over class static methods
- Export interfaces in common package
- Implement proper cleanup in error cases
- Keep file system operations in storage classes
- Use Progress Bar for CLI operations
- Follow existing React component structure
- Maintain dark theme compatibility

### Component Guidelines
- Use Tailwind's predefined utility classes only
- Implement responsive layouts (md: breakpoint)
- Follow shadcn/ui component patterns
- Keep state management in parent components
- Use consistent gap-4 for spacing
- Maintain container/content structure

### Data Flow
- Follow established caching patterns
- Use proper type imports from common
- Maintain changelog HTML structure
- Keep version comparison logic consistent
