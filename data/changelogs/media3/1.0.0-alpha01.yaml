  <p>Media3 is the new home for media support libraries, including ExoPlayer. The first alpha contains early, functional implementations of libraries for implementing media use cases, including:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>ExoPlayer, an application-level media player for Android that is easy to customize and extend.</li>
    <li>
      Media session functionality, for exposing and controlling playbacks. This new session module uses the same
      <code translate="no" dir="ltr">Player</code>
      interface as ExoPlayer.
    </li>
    <li>UI components for building media playback user interfaces.</li>
    <li>Modules wrapping functionality in other libraries for use with ExoPlayer, for example, ad insertion via the IMA SDK.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    For more information, see the
    <a href="https://github.com/androidx/media">Media3 GitHub project</a>
    .
  </p>
  <p>
    ExoPlayer was previously hosted in a separate
    <a href="https://github.com/google/ExoPlayer">ExoPlayer GitHub project</a>
    . In Media3 its package name is
    <code translate="no" dir="ltr">androidx.media3.exoplayer</code>
    . We plan to continue to maintain and release the ExoPlayer GitHub project for a while to give apps time to migrate to Media3. Media3 has replacements for all the ExoPlayer modules, except for the legacy media2 and mediasession extensions, which are replaced by the new
    <code translate="no" dir="ltr">media3-session</code>
    module. This provides direct integration between players and media sessions without needing to use an adapter/connector class.
