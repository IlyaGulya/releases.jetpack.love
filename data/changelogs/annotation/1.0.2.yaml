  <p><strong>Bug fixes</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Correct the R8/ProGuard rules which are embedded in the jar. These were incorrectly referencing the old
      <code translate="no" dir="ltr">android.support.annotation</code>
      types instead of
      <code translate="no" dir="ltr">androidx.annotation</code>
      . Note: This would have only had an impact on your builds if you were not using
      <code translate="no" dir="ltr">getDefaultProguardFile</code>
      as those default rules also included correct rules for both packages. (

      )
    </li>
    <li>
      Add a R8/ProGuard rule which explicitly keeps the @Keep annotation itself. This ensures that ProGuard does not remove the annotation from types prior to actually honoring its semantics. Note: This would have only had an impact on your builds if you were not using
      <code translate="no" dir="ltr">getDefaultProguardFile</code>
      as those default rules also included correct rules for both packages. (
