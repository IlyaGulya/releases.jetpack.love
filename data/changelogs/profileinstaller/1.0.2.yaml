  </p>
  <p><strong>Bug Fixes</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li>Added profile transcoding for P, Q, R devices. This change means that these devices will transcode the profile, ensuring that the written profile is always usable by ART. Previously transcoding would be skipped on these platforms, which sometimes lead ART to be unable to process the source profile. No changes to developer APIs.</li>
  </ul>
