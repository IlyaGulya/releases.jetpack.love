          <a href="https://developers.google.com/web/updates/2019/02/using-twa">Trusted Web Activities</a>
          .
        </li>
        <li>
          The
          <code translate="no" dir="ltr">TrustedWebActivityService</code>
          and related classes can be used to communicate with the provider - accepting web push notifications for the linked website and displaying them from the client app. This part of the API is liable to change.
        </li>
      </ul>

    <li>
      <p><strong>Custom Tab Session Ids</strong></p>

      <ul>
        <li>Custom Tabs sessions can now be created with ids, allowing the merging of two sessions launched by the same application with the same id.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p><strong>API changes</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li>Browser Actions related classes and methods have been marked deprecated. Unfortunately, while we had high hopes for the feature, barely anyone ended up using it and only one browser ended up providing support for it. Weâ€™re deprecating it to keep the code and the API simple.</li>
  </ul>
