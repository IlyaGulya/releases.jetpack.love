  </p>
  <p><strong>Important changes since 1.2.0</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li>You can now use Collections in Kotlin Multiplatform projects. Note that non-Android targets of Collections are still experimental, but we decided to merge versions to make it easier for developers to try them.</li>
    <li>
      All of the source has been migrated to Kotlin. As part of this change, many APIs are now properly typed for nullity and a few package private members have become
      <code translate="no" dir="ltr">internal</code>
      . A list of exact changes are available in the minor release notes for 1.3.x below.
    </li>
    <li>
      Along with the Kotlin migration,
      <code translate="no" dir="ltr">collection-ktx</code>
      has been merged with the main collection artifact. You can safely drop any dependencies on
      <code translate="no" dir="ltr">collection:collection-ktx</code>
      in favor of
      <code translate="no" dir="ltr">collection:collection</code>
      as
      <code translate="no" dir="ltr">collection-ktx</code>
      is now empty.
    </li>
  </ul>
