    is a new Maven artifact which supports the use of GCMNetworkManager as a scheduler when Google Play Services is available for API levels &lt;= 22. This is an optional dependency that helps with more reliable and performant background processing on older API versions. If your app uses Google Play Services, add this dependency to your gradle file to automatically get GCMNetworkManager support. If Play Services is not available, WorkManager will continue to fall back to AlarmManager on older devices.
