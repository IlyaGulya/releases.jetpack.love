  </p>
  <p><strong>New Features</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <p>Material 3 is the next evolution of Material Design and includes updated theming and redesigned components. Material 3 on Wear Compose is designed to be cohesive with the Material 3 Compose library on Android. This first alpha release contains early, functional implementations of the following:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          Material theme - configures the color scheme, typography and shapes consistently across components in the library. The Material3 theme has revised colors which support accessible contrast. (

          )
        </li>
        <li>
          Text/Icon - building blocks for Wear Compose apps (
          <a href="https://android.googlesource.com/platform/frameworks/support/+/2b07cd3007cc2a2afd2e730e46cd584ccafab343">I8e06a</a>
          )
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        We will continue to develop Wear Material (
        <code translate="no" dir="ltr">androidx.wear.compose:compose-material</code>
        ) and Wear Material 3 (
        <code translate="no" dir="ltr">androidx.wear.compose:compose-material3</code>
        ) in parallel. Future material3 releases will extend the widget set to include other familiar components from Compose for Wear OS, such as buttons, pickers, and sliders.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li><p>The Wear Material and Wear Material 3 libraries are mutually exclusive and should not be mixed in the same app, primarily because they reference different themes which would lead to unexpected inconsistencies.</p></li>
  </ul>
