      .
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Kotlin Code Generation on KSP</strong>
      has been turned ON by default if processing is done via KSP. For KAPT or Java only projects, Room will still generate Java sources.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Kotlin 2.0 and KSP2:</strong>
      Room now targets Kotlin language 2.0 and will require projects to also compile with Kotlin 2.0 and equivalent or higher language version. Support for KSP2 is also added and is recommended when using Room with Kotlin 2.0 or higher.
    </li>
  </ul>
