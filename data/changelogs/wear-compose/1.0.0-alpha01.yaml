  <p><strong>New Features</strong></p>
  <p>Wear Compose is a Kotlin, Compose-based library that supports Wear Material design, an extension of Material Design for WearOS wearables. This first alpha release contains early, functional implementations of the following:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Material theme - configures the colors, typography and shapes consistently across the components used from this library.</li>
    <li>Chip, CompactChip - chips are stadium shaped and variations are available to take icon, label and secondary label content.</li>
    <li>- ToggleChip, SplitToggleChip - a specialized type of chip that includes a slot for a bi-state toggle icon such as a radio button or checkbox. In addition, the SplitToggleChip has two tappable areas, one clickable and one toggleable.</li>
    <li>Button, CompactButton - buttons are circular in shape, with a single content slot for an icon or minimal text (maximum 3 characters).</li>
    <li>ToggleButton - a button that turns an action on or off, with a single slot for icon or minimal text (maximum 3 characters).</li>
    <li>Card, AppCard - rectangular shaped with rounded corners, offering slots for content such as app icon, time, title and body.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Future releases will extend the Widget set adding support for Wear Material Design pickers, sliders, lists, page indicators, dialogs, scroll rsb indicators, toasts and more.</p>
  <p>Additionally support will be provided for other Wearable Specific features such as curved layouts and text, as well as scaffolding to make it easy for developers to build Wearable apps/overlays.</p>
  <p>Wear Compose Material is designed with the same principles as Compose Material, although being targeted at wearables. The Wear Compose Material library should be used in place of the Compose Material library when building for a Wearable device.</p>
  <p>The two “Material” libraries should be considered mutually exclusive and should not be mixed in the same app. If developers find themselves including the Compose Material library in their dependencies it would suggest that either a) there are components missing from the Wear Compose Material library, please let us know what you need, or b) are using a component that we do not recommend for use on a Wearable Device.</p>
