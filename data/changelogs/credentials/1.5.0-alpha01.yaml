    and
    <code translate="no" dir="ltr">androidx.credentials:credentials-play-services-auth:1.5.0-alpha01</code>
    are released. This version is developed in an internal branch.

  <p><strong>New Features</strong></p>
  <p>
    Secondary UI experience for credential selection: App developers that call Credential Manager APIs at sign-in moments to present the user with a selector, are now able to use new APIs to associate the same
    <code translate="no" dir="ltr">GetCredentialRequest</code>
    with a given view, such as a username or a password field.
  </p>
  <p>Subsequently, when the user focuses on one of these views, the corresponding request will be sent to Credential Manager. The resulting credentials are aggregated across providers and displayed in autofill like secondary UIs, such as keyboard or dropdown suggestions. As such when all APIs are used together, the user is first presented with a selector, and if dismissed and taps on one of the fields mentioned above, is then presented with keyboard/dropdown suggestions.</p>
  <p><strong>API Changes</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      A
      <code translate="no" dir="ltr">PendingGetCredentialRequest</code>
      class that takes in a (pre-existing)
      <code translate="no" dir="ltr">GetCredentialRequest</code>
      , and a callback to be invoked with a (pre-existing)
      <code translate="no" dir="ltr">GetCredentialResponse</code>
      , when available asynchronously.
    </li>
    <li>
      New extension setter API for the android View class, that allows setting an instance of
      <code translate="no" dir="ltr">PendingGetCredentialRequest</code>
      . Usage of this API will prepare the given view, such that when the user taps on it, credential suggestions will show up on secondary UI experiences like keyboard/dropdown suggestions.
    </li>
  </ul>
