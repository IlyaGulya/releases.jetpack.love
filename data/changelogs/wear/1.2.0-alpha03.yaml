  </p>
  <p><strong>New Features</strong></p>
  <p>A new layout container DismissibleFrameLayout, which handles back-button-dismiss and/or swipe-to-dismiss, intended for use within an activity. At least one listener must be added to act on a dismissal action. A listener will typically remove a containing view or a fragment from the current activity. setSwipeDismissible(boolean) &amp; setBackButtonDismissible(boolean) are provided for direct control over the features. This new layout is meant to replace the existing SwipeDismissFrameLayout.</p>
  <p>Curved widgets now handle touch events. Normal widgets inside an WearArcLayout will receive all touch events, mapped to their coordinate space. WearCurvedTextView (inside an WearArcLayout or not) can set onClick and onLongClick handlers.</p>
  <p>Ongoing activities classes are now VersionedParcelables instead of using custom serialization/deserialization. The static icon and touch intent are now required.</p>
  <p><strong>API Changes</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li>The attribute "sweepDegrees" for WearCurvedTextView is separated into minSweepDegrees and maxSweepDegrees to give a more flexible layout of this widget.</li>
  </ul>
